'Autofid'

Autofid automatically localizes 32 anatomical fiducials within the human brain using trained regression forests
(see paper:https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24693).

A brief overview of each component is provided below.

autofid_main.m: main code used to localize fiducials. Combines trained regression forest for testing and automatically
formats an output .fcsv file (fiducial csv file, used primarily in 3D Slicer). See function header for more details.

dummy.fcsv: blank file that keeps .fcsv style formatting. Used in autofid_main.m to initialize structure of .fcsv file.

Haar_offsets.m: Code used to generate random Haar-like features. Already used to create coarse_haaroffset.mat, med_haaroffset.mat,
and fine_haaroffset.mat.

coarse_haaroffset.mat; med_haaroffset.mat; fine_haaroffset.mat: stored Haar-like feature offsets. DO NOT overwrite these stored offsets
unless you wish to train regression forests using new randomized offsets.

model training: folder containing code used to train coarse, medium, and fine level regression forests. Subfolders store the compact regression
forest models used to make actual predictions.

test_set: folder containing test images with ground-truth fiducials, as well as expected fiducial results from autofid.

NIfTI_tools: folder containing specialized 'load_nii' code to load nifti files in older versions of MATLAB.
